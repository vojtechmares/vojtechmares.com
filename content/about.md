### About me

Iâ€™m from Czech Republic and I am software engineer, freelancer and
DevOps consultant. I have been programming
professionally for about three years.
<br /><br />
Mostly I work on backend, but frontend is not new to me. I write web
apps in PHP. On the other hand, I would love to write Go or Java for
production. Personally I am a fan of Vue.js. I love cloud approach,
create computing (and other) resources as you need them and destroy them
when you no longer do.
<br /><br />
Also, I do not write as much code as I did a year ago, because I am
helping companies to get started with DevOps practices as a third party
consultant. In a few weeks I will be kicking off my first training on
GitLab CI.
